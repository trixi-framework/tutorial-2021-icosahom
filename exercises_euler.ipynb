For more information about Trixi and how to use it, please visit [Trixi on GitHub](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl) or refer to the [official documentation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/). \n",

    "*Note:* If you change a variable in a later cell and then re-execute an earlier cell, the results might change unexpectedly. Thus if in doubt, re-run the entire notebook *in order*. The reason is that all cells in a Jupyter notebooks share a common variable space.\n",

    "*Note:* This notebook is tested using Chromium. Most parts should also work for other browsers such as Firefox, but the videos used in the last demonstrations might not be displayed correctly.\n",
